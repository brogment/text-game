DRACULA'S DUNGEON (working title) is a text-based dungeon crawler player in the terminal.

In this game, you will create a character, choosing a class, and fight enemies in randomly generated encounters to progress.

Here are the bonus granted by each class:
Cleric - potions heal more
Rogue - always able to run away from encounters
Warrior - attack does more damage.

There is a special event if you play anytime from Christmas to New Years.
